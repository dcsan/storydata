# General Improvements / TODO
Some of these are improvement to the current game,
some are experiments I want to test out
some are for different styles of game maybe try in the next episode?

## Parser
better parsing
add synonyms - easy
try a full NLP Parser - more work, less control, less predictable
but worht trying out.

## Hint system
ideal would be if the game would work standalone. currently it doesn't, we need to babysit it.
if we see too many "I don't understand ... " then we could send out hints.
for each "step" we would need a few hints though, to gradually nudge people through a puzzle.
This needs a bit more work and a way to author it more clearly.
also maybe ding people's score if they use the hints?

## Progress Gauge
more visual indicator of how far through you are.

## Scoring
Team scores would be good
also can track individual scores, to show how many clues each person solves.
we could show something like a "leaderboard" as people progress, tracking their points.

## Emoji Feeback
if someone gets a clue, the emoji feedback seems to work really well.
even when they're discussing it, a :bulb: icon would be good to let them know they're on track...
might be harder to implement though.

## Timer?
A countdown timer could add to the pressure, and would be good if our business model required us to have someone to "host" each game run through.
But it also might stop people chatting, they'd be too frantic.
we could have clues and messages come out every 10 mins to keep the pace going and try to align to expectations?

## Deeper Characters / NPCs
if we did have a better parser, a way to chat with the characters, and more complex characters would be good.

## Branching storylines / more locations
currently it's very linear. which works well for the escape room format.
but it's a bit "fixed" for people playing. wonder if we can have some options to the storyline? ie allow users a bit more freeform navigation to different rooms, a hallway where they can decide where to go next.

## Web View Puzzle
experiment with a "web view" open a web browser
we could have a browser open up with puzzles to play in a web view.
this would allow a huge amount of creative freedom - it’s a full web browser, but may be confusing to people. also there would be no chat at this point
but the idea of a shared puzzle that pops up… could be huge. we can notify the chat when someone solves it

## replay value?
anything we can do with multiple characters, or variable items / branching stories?
this is hard with this type of format, its very story based.
but otherwise we are setting up for a "content treadmill"
we'd need at least 5 episodes before we can start charging, I think.

## media: sounds and videos
try adding sound clues, maybe video links?
links that unfurl eg to youtube may work better?
experiment.

## buttons and other controls
more interactivity in the UI? eg like the inv item buttons, or go to locations

## Map view
to show where you are (IF we had more locations)

## Web UI for authoring
make so we can edit and test the script immediately in a web view
edit in browser, then hit "test" to check any syntax errors, and "publish" to release it.
maybe then also would need a "stage" button to publish to a staging area, before "deploy" for the final version.

## More stories?
if we are to charge, we'd need a "first one is free" and then charge for premium content model.
so need a few more games.

## Website / marketing
to get people to land and be able to enter and play the game

## Reservation system
Need a way to let users 'book' a gmae, so they join at the same time as others.
Also creating new channels as private rooms with their friends?

## Bar area / channel
pre/post game a room with a barman bot, maybe he can tell you some jokes, recommend a drink...
basic ice-breaker while people gather, if we are doing a "play by appointment" model
