## Story: ###############################

- went out of sequence / task3

task1 > dress

task2 > exercise

  - match: 24 jumping jacks|24 jacks|24 jumping jacks|jump 24 times|jump 24
    if:
      all:
        - tasks.state = task2

task3 > wash

- webview / hidden object

- the soap, handle, and sandals can be gotten without actually searching for them
- look item - message even if in inv
X app / icon

- hints?

- notebook “I’mmm envioussss of youuu Jackkk. Can you matchhhhh the collllllor of my envyyyy, Jackkk?”

- "aren't fully dressed yet" check - change message?
- add image on 'look' at end
- deafening cracks
- get poster: "You take Michael Jackson off the wall"
- multiple macaroni
- prevent multiple robes / getrobe
- room description goes missing?
- show desk state on open. maybe not on close?
- wardrobe handles / states
√ skip longer sentences > 5 words
√ 'look room' global command
√ askaboutgame button broken
√ image url for drawing
√ remove boldface in poem
√ remove extra branch at start / continue - would skip 'macaroni'

- figure out tasks and lights / images out of sync?
currently:

      - name: task1
        imageUrl: asylum/rooms/cell.jpg
      - name: task2
        imageUrl: asylum/rooms/cell-1.jpg
      - name: task3
        imageUrl: asylum/rooms/cell-2.jpg
      - name: task4
        imageUrl: asylum/rooms/cell-3.jpg
      - name: task5
        imageUrl: asylum/rooms/cell-dark.jpg

- look robe when wearing. should say 'you're wearing the robe'
I removed the image call for the robe when you "look robe" because you may actually ave it in INV (as I did) at the time looking
