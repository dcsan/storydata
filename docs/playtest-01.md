it's not actually hard, it's just that they aren't being guided into how to use the parser
7:30
instead of looking around and interacting, they are failing with their commands

abbot  7:30 PM
perform = do
7:30
time for a clue?
7:30
on the parser?
7:30
parser is till kind of crap

Dr. J  7:31 PM
they got jumping jacks right but don't understand how to input
7:31
parser needs the most work

Jamin  7:32 PM
Very chaotic how they all immediately blew past their chosen leader

Dr. J  7:32 PM
needed to brute force that one a bit

DC  7:32 PM
use soap wash hands

Dr. J  7:34 PM
don't outright tell them
7:34
lo
7:34
lol
7:34
like a bunch of children

Jamin  7:34 PM
I think it's good for the test to give hints, so they keep moving along and don't check out

Dr. J  7:34 PM
hecttic

DC  7:35 PM
Mark  [7:35 PM]
use soap
cbg2  [7:35 PM]
Use soap to do what?
Mark  [7:35 PM]
to wash
cbg2  [7:35 PM]
I don’t understand to wash
7:35
multipart ones are hard

Dr. J  7:37 PM
they are often getting it right, but the parser just doesn't recognize it
7:37
yes, the wash sequence will be hard especially if they aren't fully reading the responses

DC  7:38 PM
use soap to wash hands
7:41
take handle vs take handle from wardrobe

Dr. J  7:42 PM
remove
7:42
take
7:42
get
7:42
obtain
7:42
steakl
7:42
whatever lol

DC  7:43 PM
Turn on water
7:43
might need a hint for fez etc.
7:43
think they’re stuck

Dr. J  7:43 PM
Dr. J  [10:43 AM]
use handle on piehole
cbg2  [10:43 AM]
You use the handle on the piehole but nothing happens.
7:43
give a moment

Jamin  7:44 PM
Piehole!

DC  7:50 PM
Put robe over window

Dr. J  7:50 PM
if they got the thing right but used the wrong words, i just input it for them

abbot  7:50 PM
fair enough

Dr. J  7:50 PM
use robe but the text says sandals

DC  7:50 PM
Leave
7:51
yeah i know

abbot  7:51 PM
lets see if they get stuck in the epilogue
7:51
i dont think anyone noticed macaroni
7:51
can we give them a hint?

Dr. J  7:52 PM
shorten the text at the end so no (read more)
7:52
the images aren't right yet for the end
7:53
That was on speed
7:53
prob good to limit the players for a game at 5

Dr. J  8:00 PM
Dan B  [10:59 AM]
I think if group game, set a timer for 'discussion'and then an "action decision"
8:00
This is a good format for more of a d&d game
8:00
would be interesting
8:00
wouldn't work well for an open-ended game where you have to look all over
8:00
maybe time to discuss though

DC  8:00 PM
yeah if more complex puzzles

Dr. J  8:01 PM
I think if there is a clear input leader this takes the place of that

DC  8:01 PM
i think for this game tho it was good everyone got a chance to play
8:01
not too cerebral

Dr. J  8:01 PM
because there wasn't an input leader, the discussions weren't really heard

DC  8:01 PM
its like an action text adventure haha

Dr. J  8:01 PM
maybe there's a type of game design that works well for a free for all
8:02
as if you are all having to go at once to do something
8:02
the game is: cook a meal for a VIP
8:02
run around the kitchen finding things
8:02
"Under Pressure Simulator"
8:02
forces you to talk together amidst the chaos

DC  8:03 PM
interesting

Jamin  8:25 PM
Nice work guys!

Dr. J  8:29 PM
Good job team
8:29
got some work to do

DC  8:29 PM
yep, thanks!
8:29
took about an hour to run through
8:29
def some food for thought
8:29
i think parser is the big thing

Dr. J  8:29 PM
One of the main decisions to make is how far we want to develop the parser. Once there is indeed a limit on this, we can inform the players what those limits are, and tailor the game to suit this
8:30
If it were more flexible, the players can do alot more and we can develop the puzzles further

DC  8:30 PM
yeah i might look into an NLP parser, which would be a lot more flexible, but also less “surgical”

Dr. J  8:30 PM
if not, then we can limit the kinds of puzzles and the UI

DC  8:30 PM
harder to control, but more forgiving

Dr. J  8:30 PM
either way, we just can move forward more intentionally

DC  8:30 PM
i do have a synonym system already tho, just need to add to it

Dr. J  8:32 PM
and if the players jump the order of puzzles that could possibly break the gameplay
8:32
that's a bit harder to solve

DC  8:32 PM
i think i can lock it with the system that’s there, just takes some more scripting

Dr. J  8:33 PM
either we code it or we create puzzle progression that doesn't require this

DC  8:33 PM
some of them are locked already
8:33
but then we need to give clues if they hit a locked situation

Dr. J  8:33 PM
its always the same issue of freedom vs. constraint in a game
8:33
we can just decide what we think is best to dev

DC  8:33 PM
well open ended is always a lot more costly

Dr. J  8:33 PM
yes, if they solve something early there needs to be an indication of "... not yet"

DC  8:33 PM
so lets not go too far in that direction!

Dr. J  8:34 PM
otherwise they delete that from their mind and may later not do it

DC  8:34 PM
right
8:34
so it doesnt ignore you, it hints you

Jamin  8:37 PM
See you guys tmrw

DC  8:38 PM
thanks for hosting, was fun!
8:39
ll setup another dummy account if i lost the PW for abbot, so we can give clues “in character” tmrw

Dr. J  8:46 PM
Jamin, do you just want to play abbot?
