Hi there -

We chatted a bit before,
We're doing a small playtest group tonight, if you would have time to join?

As I reminder I'm building an escape room game in Slack.

If you can share an email address I could add you to some other ones and send a google cal invite (easier for timezones)

More info below.

The game is called Escape From Bell Hill Asylum

It's played in Slack and you can join here:

We're running it with a host to guide you through, and the session kicks off at the time below.
Usually groups take about 30~40 mins and we'd like to ask you a few questions about the game afterward.
(maybe quicker for you if you've played many games before)

Let me know if you'd like to join! (timezones below)

Before playing!

The game is built in Slack, which you can access via a web browser
OR download the app from the appstores. The signup link will guide you through the process but you might want to download and setup before hand if you've never used Slack before.
