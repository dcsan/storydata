You accept an invitation to playtest a new physical escape room. The setting of the game is a mental asylum called 'Bell Hill'. Having signed the game’s standard NDA, you climb into bed early Friday night, full of anticipation.
After all, you love escape rooms.

Saturday morning, you arrive at the venue and are greeted by a female host wearing a white lab coat. After placing your belongings in a locker, you are led down a long hallway to a simple bedroom. In the game, you will play the role of a male inmate of Bell Hill.
Your goal is to escape the asylum.

The host informs you the game will last one hour, followed by a short debrief. If you are ever stuck or want to leave, just say the safe word macaroni. She wishes you good luck and exits through the door by which you came. It closes seamlessly, becoming part of a blank wall of the room.
7:05
You have just begun to examine your surroundings when the real door of the room opens, and two burly men dressed as what you take to be orderlies enter.

Before you can speak, one of the orderlies locks you in bear-like grip while the other strips your pants off your legs. Your shirt is torn off next, leaving you only in your underwear and socks.
7:05
“Is this part of the game?!” you stammer angrily.
“It’s all in the terms and conditions,” says the first orderly.
“Looking forward to your escape attempts!” chuckles the other, following his partner out.
“Geesh,” you think, “That’s maybe a bit much…”
The door shuts with a resounding click.

You turn the poster over to see the following scrawled in black Sharpie:

He did the deed then all were done.

The hallway is bathed in sickly green light as the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host. As you disappear deeper into the asylum, you hear the host call out.
