Jamin  7:09 PM
Thank you Tara! Ok, I have a few housekeeping items and then we'll start. No Zoom, Mark.

Jamin  7:09 PM

Everyone, Abbot runs The Asylum.

abbot  7:09 PM

Jamin  7:09 PM
So. Thanks all for helping test this game! You'll get a feedback form later, but please jot down any notes about what you liked, what was confusing, etc.

Once the game begins, you'll enter commands to move the story along. To chat only with your group, type a period and a space before your message. Also, any entry of 6 or more words will be ignored by the game.
Any of you can enter a command, but it might get chaotic if you're all doing that, because there are seven in your group. You might want to select one person to do the inputting.
I will be with you, but I know some of the story, so I won't contribute to the gameplay if it's a section I'm familiar with.

The lights in the facility drop out with a heavy crack, and the hallway is bathed in sickly green light. The rough hands of the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host. As you disappear deeper into the asylum, you hear her call out.

“You should have read the terms and…

Lena  7:54 PM
. Haha

DC  7:55 PM
, zoom or chat

Dr. J  7:55 PM
. do we get free early access to the real games for play testing???

Jason  7:55 PM
You should get positive aquatic animal sounds when you get something right

DC  7:55 PM
. which of the puzzles do you think made sense, and which were too hard / oblique ?

Matt  7:55 PM
. are we finished or is there more game to go through?

DC  7:56 PM
. that’s it for so far…

Dan B  7:56 PM
So did any specific reference to a Michael Jackson song from Off the Wall matter or did i miss something?

cbg2APP  7:56 PM
left jaminslobby1.

Jamin  7:56 PM
I think the idea was to take the poster "off the wall"

Matt  7:56 PM
ah yes

Jason  7:56 PM
. the off the wall thing seemed accidental not sure what the train of thought was
7:56
ahh

DC  7:57 PM
pun pun

Jamin  7:57 PM
The bot is gone; no need for dot space now

Dr. J  7:57 PM
. someone typed take poster off the wall but it didn't register
7:57
i think it was lena tearing it up

Jason  7:57 PM
ok yeah

DC  7:57 PM
interseting how you agreed on a leader at the start, and then it was a melée soon after!

Dr. J  7:58 PM
what would the ideal number of players be?

Jason  7:58 PM
there was no official vote

Matt  7:58 PM
I think melee worked well

Dr. J  7:58 PM
vote y mail

DC  7:58 PM
yeah its fun i think

Dr. J  7:58 PM
by

Jason  7:58 PM
melee prolly OK if folks are not umpy
7:58
jumpy

Dr. J  7:58 PM
did anyone twist an ankle in all the chaos?
7:59
alot of synonym issues
7:59
and general input issues
7:59
people got the idea right, but the game didn't recognize the input

Dan B  7:59 PM
I think if group game, set a timer for 'discussion'and then an "action decision"

Dr. J  7:59 PM
there are limits on what it understands

DC  8:00 PM
that could work, for larger decisions, but i think here we have a lot of small ones…

Matt  8:00 PM
I thought it was great

DC  8:00 PM
where did you feel most frustration, can you remember?
8:00
or even after a puzzle like “hmm, that didn’t make sense” vs “oh … now I get it !”

Matt  8:01 PM
I mean, in the end nothing stumped us so I think we figured it out.

DC  8:01 PM
i saw sometimes… i think Lena propose things, but then the chat moved on

Jason  8:01 PM
couldnt you 'assign' the App to respond only to One person?

Matt  8:01 PM
And it was good to include some irrelavent dead end clues

Jamin  8:02 PM
I was confused by the Hans, Nick etc. but the group had enough mental firepower to blast through it

Matt  8:02 PM
yeah that was the only thing
:smile:

DC  8:02 PM
we were there to guide you. did the emoji reactions make sense? as a kind of “getting warmer…”

Dan B  8:02 PM
It just moved so fast with everybody chiming in, not even sure what the solutions to any puzzle were

Matt  8:02 PM
but we had enough ppl to figure it out
8:02
emoji reactions?
:+1:
1


DC  8:03 PM
these ^
8:03
or too subtle ?

Jamin  8:03 PM
I wonder if some ppl get left out in the melee style. Like Dan said, some of the solutions just whizzed by

Dr. J  8:03 PM
Need a handicap due to Lena

Matt  8:03 PM
mm yeah, those are cool esp. in a slack messaging context

Dr. J  8:03 PM
yeah solutions came pretty quick

Dan B  8:03 PM
Don't understand the action boxes that seemed to suggest only one choose your own adventure choice

DC  8:04 PM
ok fair point.
8:04
i think those are really just to move the narrative along
8:04
but they maybe mislead you into thinking its a choice (with a missing choice)?

Jason  8:04 PM
heading out now... thanks

Dr. J  8:04 PM
I think at the pace it went, it seemed that "look" "use" "open" type puzzles were what the group was hungry for, so any cerebral puzzles changed the pace. It was hard to slow down and figure out the poster puzzle because of this
8:05
thx Jason

Jamin  8:05 PM
Jason mentioned he couldn't suspend disbelief. I think the creepy/suspenseful moments got buried in lots of typing

Dr. J  8:06 PM
Maybe a limit on players would solve a few issues

DC  8:06 PM
how many ppl were active at the same time? maybe 4 ? plus us… (edited) 

Jamin  8:06 PM
Cool creepy story, but "open window with piehole soap" kind of ruins that

DC  8:06 PM
there was some punning along the way …

Jamin  8:07 PM
We had 7 ppl but a few hardly contributed

Dr. J  8:07 PM
I think ultimately there could be different offerings--- creepy vs lighthearted
8:07
so eventually the players can choose what they want to play

Lena  8:07 PM
Honestly it was a similar level of chaos to the one escape room
I have done in person
:white_check_mark:

Mark  8:07 PM
i find these things fun but maddening when you have to say the command in the way the bot wants you to say it

Jamin  8:07 PM
No, I just meant any mood was punctures by lots of typing
8:07
Punctured

DC  8:07 PM
yeah, the parser was furstrating, sorry about that

Lena  8:07 PM
I can’t type as fast as I think

Dr. J  8:08 PM
I think the parser will always be the biggest challenge for us yeah

Mark  8:08 PM
just feels more of a tech logic puzzle than anything else

DC  8:08 PM
@Jamin not sure how to get around that, any ideas?

Dr. J  8:08 PM
If we go with more buttons, it limits the puzzle solving

DC  8:08 PM
yeah we can be a lot more forgiving with the parser, so if you’re in the right direction we could let you go through

Dan B  8:08 PM
I've deleted twelve answers to this chat as I've seen it go by,  i had a thought about something a minute ago and now it's irrelevant
:laughing:

Dr. J  8:08 PM
The parser and commands can be very narrowly defined

DC  8:09 PM
who is on a phone vs. a laptop with keyboard ?

Dr. J  8:09 PM
i.e. only use, get, open, look, etc. listed clearly

DC  8:09 PM
a phone FYI the voice input is very good now…

Jamin  8:09 PM
DC, maybe by only letting one person input commands, the mood could be sustained or even amplified. But that would definitely slow things down

Dan B  8:09 PM
Phone with swype and i still feel at a disadvantage

Jamin  8:09 PM
Phone

Dr. J  8:10 PM
@Jamin maybe try that tomorrow with group 2
8:10
I think you need to have a leader

DC  8:10 PM
i kind of like the hectic nature of it, tho its less thoughtful
8:10
if i was playing i’m not sure i’d have the patience to sit back and suggest, i just wanna try it
8:11
but i guess diffrent ppl have different playing styles.  depends on the puzzle too
8:11
the “get handle” one seemed to stump ppl i was a bit surprised

Mark  8:11 PM
anyone want to chat on zoom? i can share a link

Jamin  8:11 PM
When playing escape rooms IRL, I always lingered back and examined the props and set more than tried to figure out the clues

DC  8:11 PM
thats a big visual clue right in the room

Mark  8:11 PM
The chat is kind of maddening to me at this point of the night

DC  8:12 PM
Call
Call Ended
Ended at 8:14 PM - Lasted 2 minutes

3 people joined
8:12
just a voice call, no video :smile:
8:13
hmm I can’t seem to hear anyone

Jamin  8:14 PM
Dang
8:14
We hear you

DC  8:14 PM
all i get is slack notification sound nearly blow out my eardrums :sob:

Jamin  8:14 PM
Eesh

Mark  8:15 PM
we hear you we see you and we support you

Jamin  8:15 PM
Tara! What's up!

Mark  8:15 PM
I feel like I walked back into like 2004 for a second

Tara  8:16 PM
Hi all- I’m signing off. But I’ll be on the look out for the email about additional feedback! Thanks!

Jamin  8:16 PM
Thx T

DC  8:16 PM
thanks @Tara

Mark  8:16 PM
seeya tara

DC  8:16 PM
@Mark i hear ya, its definitely a different take in 2020 compared to Fortnite and the type of games the kidz are playing

Dr. J  8:16 PM
i think " get handle" stumped people because it took the time to look

DC  8:17 PM
but the idea is to get people to talk … so some kind of puzzles where people think and chat together.
8:17
not sure we achieved that here, it was a bit frantic rather than “collaborative”. but frantic is fun

Jamin  8:17 PM
I really like the chatting and hanging out; if only it didn't make the game so bumpy

Mark  8:17 PM
But why can’t they talk via video chat seems very I don’t know how to put it but like limiting
:+1:

DC  8:18 PM
yeah, it could be discord is a good platform for this as it has really good audio call support
8:18
while ppl are playing
8:18
not quite as  good on things like buttons in the UI tho
8:18
tho we didn’t use that so much

Jamin  8:19 PM
A few people asked me if they had to get on a Zoom for the game

DC  8:19 PM
yeah. i mean, we could have a zoom call going at the same time
:+1:
1

8:19
even just an audio call
8:19
would certainly be easier to coordinate

Jamin  8:19 PM
Oh, I was a little confused how a button to advance the story also looked like inventory item buttons

Mark  8:20 PM
It felt like kind of a button mash to find the right combination that worked for the algorithm
8:20
We were all just jamming it with different variations of the same thing

DC  8:20 PM
yeah definitely there were things that should have worked

Mark  8:20 PM
Maybe that’s the way it works

DC  8:21 PM
you were nearly there a few times. well tonight is the first play through, we’ll add a lot more captures

Mark  8:21 PM
I feel like we should be penalized for giving final commands or something though

Jamin  8:21 PM
I can penalize you Mark.

DC  8:21 PM
penalized if you get it wrong?

Jamin  8:21 PM
You owe me three beers!

abbot  8:21 PM
penalize is Abbot's job!

Jamin  8:21 PM
Sorry!

Mark  8:21 PM
Like as a way to disincentive just jamming it with 1 million commands (edited) 

abbot  8:22 PM
oh i still have that woman's wine

DC  8:22 PM
maybe we would be better off rewarding you
8:22
did you feel the lightbulbs there were a sign of progress?

Mark  8:22 PM
 Yeah maybe you could make those more prominent when something was said right to signal that they are on the right track
8:23
I think we all kind of gathered that by the bot commands though
8:23
it was fun good job

Jamin  8:24 PM

the image of the room with lights one should come up with each puzzle solved

DC  8:26 PM
we could also use a progress bar from a message

Mark  8:26 PM
 Yeah just some kind of digital flash to show you that you have succeeded and moved onto the next phase that would give the participants some element of glee

DC  8:29 PM
if the lights were horizontal we could inline them into the conversation more easily without taking up so much space, and make an animation. then it wouldn’t spolit the context so much

not sure how well that works in parallel with slack on a phone also

Mark  8:32 PM
Then they fail if they don’t complete it by that time

Dr. J  8:32 PM
death

DC  8:32 PM
haha yeah. we could also add a countdown timer to the game
8:32
every 5 mins it will notify you …
8:32
maybe a 30 mins game and 10 mins chat after

Lena  8:34 PM
It was cool - nicely done!

Dr. J  8:34 PM
wash Nick

Jamin  8:34 PM
Thx Lena!

Dr. J  8:34 PM
when someone said "what rhymes with Nick"
8:34
that was a bit of a faux pas

Jamin  8:34 PM
I thought Nick meant I had to shave

DC  8:35 PM
