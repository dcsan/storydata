        Chapter One : The Room

        \nStripped of your clothing and possessions before entering,
        you stand in your underwear waiting for this mental asylum-themed escape room game to begin.
        \n
        \nA voice calls out from an unseen speaker:
        \n
        \n> _If you want to end the game for any reason, you can simply say the safe word, **macaroni**._

        \nThe door to the room locks with a firm click.

        \nI guess the game has begun...

        \nYou are in what appears to be a mental patient’s bedroom. There's a desk in front of you.
