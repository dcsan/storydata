            Once we begin, you'll enter text commands to move the story along.
            Whatever you type will be considered a command by the game.
            To chat only with your group, type a period and a space before your message.
            \n
            `. Like this!`
            \n
            Also, any entry of 6 or more words will be ignored by the game.
            Anyone can enter a command, so if it gets too hectic, you might want to select one person to do the inputting.

            You can type `help` to learn the basic commands
            _Enjoy!_
