        \nYou can type commands or click emoji to interact with the game
        \nYou are playing as a team. Anyone can enter a command, so if it gets too hectic, you might want to select one person to do the inputting.
        \nTo chat with your group, type a period and a space before your message:
        \n> `. Like this!`
        \n

          When the game starts, these are the basic commands:
      \n> `L` to look around the room
      \n> `X [thing]` to examine an item
      \n> `INVentory` for what you're carrying
      \n> `tasks` to see what to do next
      \n> `Say [something] to [person]` talk to in-game characters
      \n> `use [thing] with [thing]` try combining items
      \n> put a `.` in front of a message to chat to other players
      \n> There are many other things you can try, but these are the basics!
