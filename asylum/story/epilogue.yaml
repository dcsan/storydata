          \n_“Don’t let them fool you”_ she moans
          \n _“Okay,”_ you think to yourself _“Maybe this is a bit much for a Saturday morning…”_
          \nThe orderlies appear behind her."

            _“This isn’t a game…”_ she gurgles.
            \nWithout a moment’s hesitation, one of the orderlies draws a handgun and fires three quick rounds.
            \nThe deafening cracks of each roll and echo around the hallway sickeningly as you watch her collapse in a pool of… fake blood?
            \nOkay. You’ve had enough. This isn’t fun.

            You see the host in the lab coat who welcomed you taking furious notes on a clipboard at the end of the hallway.
            \n
            Maybe she didn’t hear you."

            The woman looks up at you wanly and motions to the orderlies.
            _”This man is having delusions of being in an Italian restaurant,”_ she says.
            _“He is clearly insane. Take him to *the tower*.”_
            The men advance on you."

            The lights in the facility drop out with a heavy crack,
            and the hallway is bathed in sickly green light.
            The rough hands of the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host.
            As you disappear deeper into the asylum, you hear her call out. \n
