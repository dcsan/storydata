          “This isn’t a game…”_ she gurgles.
          \n Without a moment’s hesitation, one of the orderlies draws a handgun and fires. The woman collapses in a pool of… fake blood?
          \n Okay. You’ve had enough. This isn’t fun.

            the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host. As you disappear deeper into the asylum, you hear the host call out.
