          <br> _“Don’t let them fool you”_ she moans.
          <br> _“Okay,”_ you think to yourself _“Maybe this is a bit much for a Saturday morning…”_
          <br> The orderlies appear behind her."

            _“This isn’t a game…”_ she gurgles.
            \nWithout a moment’s hesitation, one of the orderlies draws a handgun and fires three quick rounds.
            \nThe deafening crack of each roll and echo around the hallway sickeningly as you watch her collapse in a pool of… fake blood?
            \nOkay. You’ve had enough. This isn’t fun.

            How do you tell them you’ve had enough?
            You see the host in the lab coat who welcomed you taking furious notes on a clipboard at the end of the hallway.
            \n
            Maybe she didn’t hear you.

            The lights in the facility drop out with a heavy crack,
            and the hallway is bathed in sickly green light.
            The rough hands of the orderlies grab you and drag you in the opposite direction of the host.
            As you disappear deeper into the asylum, you hear her call out. \n
            _“You should have read the terms and conditions more carefully, Jack.”_
